# CampusHub
CampusHub is a centralized web platform that brings together all college events in one place, making it easy for students to discover and register for activities across departments and clubs. Built with Vite and React on the frontend and MongoDB on the backend, the platform ensures a smooth and responsive user experience. Only admins such as CPs and VCPs need to register and verify their identity through an OTP-based faculty approval system, allowing them to post new events. Students can freely browse and register for events without the need to log in, making participation quick and hassle-free while ensuring that all posted events are verified and authentic.
